## Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   npm run scan-watched        # Collect your viewing history
   npm run scan-all-bookmarks  # Import existing bookmarks
   ```

2. **Rate Your Content** (Optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   npm run rate-content
   ```
   - Rate items 1-10 based on how much you enjoyed them
   - Add notes to explain why you liked/disliked something
   - This dramatically improves AI recommendation quality

3. **Generate Recommendations**
   ```bash
   npm run ai-recommend        # For both movies and shows
   # or
   npm run ai-recommend-movies # Movies only
   npm run ai-recommend-shows  # TV shows only
   ```

4. **Check Results**
   - Recommendations are automatically added to your "ai-recommendations" bookmark folder on kino.pub
   - Run `npm run scan-bookmarks ai-recommendations` to update local cache

## Rating Guidelines

- **9-10**: Absolutely loved it, would watch again
- **7-8**: Really enjoyed it, would recommend to others
- **5-6**: It was okay, watchable but not memorable
- **3-4**: Didn't like it, had issues but finished it
- **1-2**: Hated it, couldn't finish or regret watching

## Notes Examples

Good notes help the AI understand your preferences:
- "Great character development"
- "Too slow paced"
- "Loved the humor"
- "Confusing plot"
- "Amazing cinematography"
- "Too violent for my taste"
- "Perfect ending"

## Database Location

The SQLite database is stored as `kino-pub-data.db` in your project root. You can:
- Back it up by copying this file
- View it with any SQLite browser tool
- Reset it by deleting the file (data will be lost)

## Migration from JSON

If you have existing JSON files (`watched-shows.json`, `ai-bookmarks.json`), the new system will ignore them and start fresh with the database. Your kino.pub account data remains unchanged and can be re-scanned at any time.
